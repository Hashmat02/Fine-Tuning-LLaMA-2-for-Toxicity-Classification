    "After the launch of Meta's LLaMA, there was a surge in the development of improved Large Language Models (LLMs), fostering innovation within the open-source community. This resulted in a plethora of models competing for attention, creating a vibrant atmosphere. However, challenges arose, including limited licenses, exclusive fine-tuning capabilities, and high deployment costs. In response, LLaMA 2 strategically entered the scene, introducing a commercial license to enhance accessibility. It also implemented innovative methodologies, enabling fine-tuning on consumer GPUs with restricted memory, addressing the limitations of the post-launch era and contributing to a more inclusive and efficient AI landscape.\n",
    "\n",
    "LLAMA-2's significance extends beyond licensing adjustments. It pioneers Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT), a technique that notably streamlines the fine-tuning process by reducing the number of model parameters requiring updates. This efficiency not only accelerates training times but also reduces computational costs, making LLAMA-2 a resource-efficient option for researchers and developers. Moreover, its baseline performance shines across diverse benchmarks, consistently surpassing other LLMs in terms of accuracy and effectiveness. This robust performance suggests that fine-tuned LLAMA-2 models hold promise across various applications, establishing it as a compelling choice in the landscape of advanced language models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite the acknowledgment of potentially superior models, the literature underscores the unique strengths that position LLAMA-2 as a standout choice. Many advanced models lack open-source availability, restricting access to model weights. Conversely, some open-source models lack support for crucial functionalities like PEFT and QLORA. LLAMA-2 emerges as a pragmatic solution, offering a blend of strong baseline performance, support for advanced features, and crucially, open-source accessibility. In a field where trade-offs are common, LLAMA-2 strikes a balance, presenting itself as an inclusive and compelling option for those seeking a versatile and accessible LLM for varied applications.\n",
